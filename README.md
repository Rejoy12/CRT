# **Unveiling the CRT: A Turbo C++ Masterpiece**  

## 🚀 About the Project  
Step into the intricate workings of a **Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)** with this striking visualization! This project showcases an **interactive and annotated CRT diagram**, built with precision using **Turbo C++ graphics**, highlighting its core components like the electron beam, anodes, and phosphor-coated screen in a visually stunning presentation.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Artful Graphics**: A beautifully crafted CRT schematic using geometric shapes like lines, arcs, and rectangles.  
- **Detailed Labels**: Every CRT component is annotated for maximum clarity and understanding.  
- **Innovative Design**: Bold color contrasts and a clean, structured layout for visual impact.  

## 🖥️ How to Run  
1. Install Turbo C++ or configure DOSBox for legacy graphics.  
2. Set the BGI path to `C:\\Turboc3\\BGI`.  
3. Compile and run the code to unlock the visual journey of CRT technology.  

## 🌟 Why It Stands Out  
This project isn't just a technical achievement—it's an artistic endeavor merging innovation, education, and creativity, appealing to both enthusiasts and newcomers alike.
